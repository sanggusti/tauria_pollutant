Tauria Machine Learning Engineer Candidate Challenge

## Question

1. What kinds of Data Treatment techniques would apply to this dataset in order to make it suitable to a Machine Learning Model that aims to predict O3 concentration for the next 4 hours? Explain why you would apply said techniques.

2. What Models would you say are suitable to use in this dataset in order to predict 4 hours ahead? Explain why you would use said Models.

3. The team would like to use the "best" performing trained model from the previous step in a live application to show the models predictions to customers. What metrics and tools can help identify the "best" performing models?
